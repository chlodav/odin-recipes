<h3>What You Need to Make Banana Pancakes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Flour. 
        All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
    <li>An Egg. 
        Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.</li>
    <li>Milk. 
        Not only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.</li>
    <li>Baking Powder. 
        Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.</li>
    <li>Bananas. 
        Last but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Make Banana Pancakes</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).</li>
    <li>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
